# Doctor Room Monitoring System (Multi-purpose Monitoring)

This project is an **IoT-based monitoring system** designed using Arduino UNO and LEDs.  
It simulates the presence of a doctor either in their **office** or in the **operation room**:

- **Red LED ON** → Doctor in Office  
- **Green LED ON** → Doctor in Operation Room  

---

## 🌍 Applications
Although designed as a **Doctor Room Monitoring System**, the project can also be applied in other fields where presence/absence indication is important:

- 🏥 **Hospitals & Clinics** → Show if the doctor is in office or in operation room  
- ⛏️ **Mines & Industrial Sites** → Indicate whether a worker is inside a tunnel, shaft, or dangerous zone  
- 🏫 **Schools/Offices** → Show if a room is occupied or vacant  

This flexibility makes the project suitable for **safety monitoring** and **status indication** in multiple industries.
