# 🚀 Mining Sensor Project (Tinkercad + Arduino)

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a **mining sensor system** using Tinkercad.  
It includes Arduino code, circuit schematics, and a 3D-printed case design.  

The goal is to demonstrate how embedded systems can be used in **mining safety** (e.g., gas detection, vibration monitoring, or smart alert systems).
